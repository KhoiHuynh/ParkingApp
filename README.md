**BACKGROUND**</br>
With the increasing amount of vehicles on the roads everyday, it gets harder and harder to find
parking in crowded urban areas. There are millions of people across majors cities that drive
around in circles to find parking spots. An estimated 30% of the cars in downtown traffic are cars
cruising for parking . This is an astounding number, and it results in a lot of wasted time, money,
traffic congestion and pollution that goes into the environment from just trying to find parking.

**OVERVIEW**</br>
My aim is to create a mobile application for the android platform that can help solve the issues
mentioned above. The goal is to create an application that links drivers with private parking spot
owners in the hopes of providing affordable and reliable parking in urban areas. Spot owners can
host their unused private driveways to drivers looking for parking in hard-to-park areas. The
application aims to remove the hassle of finding parking on a busy day. Now users can just find a
convenient spot that is available on the map, book it and drive directly to it instead of having to
circle around for a parking spot.
The application will be designed so that it is user-friendly and easy to use. The main space of the
app will be a view of the already familiar google maps. This is where users can browse for
available spots that will be indicated by pins. When a user taps on a pin, it will display all the
necessary information such as the fees, address, payment, etc...
With the current popularity of the mobile platform, this application makes sense. Almost everyone
who drives a car has a smartphone. The application could have a large range of uses, ranging
from regular commuters to tourist visiting a downtown area.</br>

The above app is fully functional with a serverless backend (firebase) and functioning payment methods (stripe) but due to lack of time available within the team it has been placed on hold, we have an intention to come back to this in the future but there is no timeline.
